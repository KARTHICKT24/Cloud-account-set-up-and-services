## AIM:
To create a cloud account in Microsoft Azure and to explore its services such as Compute, IoT, and Security.

## PROCEDURE:
Step 1: Go to the Azure Website

•	Visit https://azure.microsoft.com

•	Click on “Start free” or “Free account” in the top right corner.


Step 2: Sign Up with Microsoft Account

•	If you already have a Microsoft account (Outlook/Hotmail), sign in.

Step 7: Sign In to Azure Portal

•	Go to https://portal.azure.com

•	Sign in with your Microsoft account.

•	This is the main dashboard where you can explore all Azure services.


## Create a User with Administrative Access (Azure Active Directory):

### **Secure your Azure account root user**

•	Sign in to the Azure Portal as the account owner.

•	Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your account.


### **Create a new administrative user**

## Services Overview in Azure:

Azure provides 200+ cloud services. In this experiment, we focus on the following key categories:

### 1. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

# Explanation:

Azure Virtual Machines provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

They let users create virtual computers in the cloud, running Windows or Linux, without needing physical hardware.

Useful for development, testing, hosting applications, or backup servers.

# Features:

Supports multiple OS (Windows, Linux).

Customizable CPU, memory, and storage.

Integration with Azure networking and load balancing.

Pay-as-you-go pricing model.

Option to create VM images for faster deployment.

# Advantages:

Flexibility → Run any software or OS.

Scalability → Easily increase/decrease resources.

Cost-effective → Pay only for usage.

Business continuity → Backup and disaster recovery supported.

### 2. Azure Blob Storage

# Explanation:

Blob = Binary Large Object → Used to store unstructured data like images, videos, logs, and backups.

Provides different storage tiers: Hot, Cool, Archive for cost optimization.

Suitable for media streaming, file sharing, and data archiving.

# Features:

Three blob types: Block Blobs, Append Blobs, Page Blobs.

Supports massive scalability for large data.

Redundancy options (LRS, GRS, ZRS) for data safety.

Access control through Shared Access Signatures (SAS).

Integration with CDN for faster content delivery.

# Advantages:

Scalable → Store unlimited unstructured data.

Secure → Encrypted and redundant storage.

Cost-efficient → Pay only for what you use with multiple tiers.

Global access → Data can be delivered worldwide at high speed.

### 3. Azure SQL Database

# Explanation:

A Platform as a Service (PaaS) relational database.

Based on Microsoft SQL Server but fully managed in the cloud.

Handles automatic backups, patching, scaling, and monitoring.

Ideal for apps needing reliable and secure structured data storage.

# Features:

Automatic scaling based on workload.

High availability with built-in failover.

Advanced security (encryption, authentication, threat detection).

AI-powered performance tuning.

Multi-model support (relational + JSON).

# Advantages:

No maintenance → Microsoft manages updates and backups.

Secure → Built-in encryption and compliance.

Scalable → Easily adjusts to workload changes.

Reliable → High uptime with disaster recovery features.
