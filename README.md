## Services Overview in Azure:

Azure provides 200+ cloud services. In this experiment, we focus on the following key categories:

## 1. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

# Explanation:

Azure Virtual Machines provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

They allow users to create and manage virtual computers in the cloud that run Windows or Linux.

VMs can be used for hosting applications, software testing, development, or disaster recovery.

Advantages:

Flexible – Can run any operating system and software.

Scalable – Increase or decrease computing power as per demand.

Cost-effective – Pay only for the time the VM is running.

Supports backup and disaster recovery without extra hardware.

## 2. Azure Blob Storage

# Explanation:

Blob stands for Binary Large Object.

It is used to store unstructured data such as images, videos, logs, backups, and documents.

Supports three types of blobs: Block Blobs, Append Blobs, and Page Blobs.

Provides multiple access tiers – Hot (frequent use), Cool (infrequent use), Archive (rare use).

# Advantages:

Highly scalable and reliable storage.

Cost-efficient with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Data is secure with encryption and redundancy.

Suitable for media streaming, backup, and archiving.

### 3. Azure SQL Database

# Explanation:

Azure SQL Database is a Platform as a Service (PaaS).

It is a fully managed relational database based on Microsoft SQL Server.

Features include automatic backups, patching, scaling, and high availability.

Ideal for applications that need secure and consistent data storage.

# Advantages:

No need for hardware or database server maintenance.

High security with encryption and authentication.

Auto-scaling to handle variable workloads.

Built-in high availability and disaster recovery.
